# Banking-Application-API

<p>
This is a dynamic Banking Application API using Spring Boot, featuring two controllers: CustomerController for customer management (add, delete, view) and TransactionController for handling transactions (balance enquiry, withdrawal, deposit, transfer). Utilized MySQL for storing customer and transaction data, adhering to design patterns with organized packages (Controllers, Dao, Entities, Services). 
I have employed Postman for thorough API testing.
